```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Loading libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Reading in the datafiles

```{r}
# set relative brewery file path as variable
beers_csv <- here("project_files", "Beers.csv")
breweries_csv <- here("project_files", "Breweries.csv")

# initialize dataframes
beers <- data.frame(read.csv(beers_csv))
breweries <- data.frame(read.csv(breweries_csv))

head(beers)
head(breweries)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
